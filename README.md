# SQL Query Issues: Empty Result Sets and Data Type Mismatches

This repository demonstrates two common, yet subtle, issues that can arise when working with SQL queries:

1. **Empty Result Sets:**  A query might return an empty result set if no rows match the specified criteria. While this isn't technically an error, it can cause unexpected behavior in applications that don't handle empty results gracefully.
2. **Data Type Mismatches:**  If a WHERE clause compares columns of different data types, the comparison might produce unintended results.

The `bug.sql` file contains a sample query illustrating both these issues.  The `bugSolution.sql` file shows how to mitigate these problems.

The solutions include checking for the presence of data after querying and explicitly casting data types for comparisons.  Always handle edge cases, such as empty result sets, and ensure data type consistency for reliable and predictable query behavior.
